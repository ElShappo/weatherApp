## A simple web application to get the weather in the desired region. 

Note that this application uses OpenWeatherAPI to fetch the data, thus sometimes the weather details might be imprecise.

To view weather in your region you can click the location icon. Before that you may need to allow your browser to get your location.

The application is running under the following link: [https://weatherquasar.netlify.app/#/](https://weatherquasar.netlify.app/#/)
